# ‚úÖ Procedure: Setting Up and Testing ProtonVPN

---

### 1. **Choose a VPN Provider**

I selected **ProtonVPN** because it‚Äôs free, reliable, and focuses on privacy. It's a good starting point for learning how VPNs work.

---

### 2. **Create an Account**

I went to [https://protonvpn.com](https://protonvpn.com) and signed up for a free account.
It asked for my email and I had to verify it before logging in.

---

### 3. **Download and Install the VPN App**

After logging in, I downloaded the ProtonVPN client for **Windows**.
Installation was simple ‚Äî just followed the setup wizard like any normal software.

---

### 4. **Login and Connect to a VPN Server**

I opened the app and logged in.
Then I clicked **‚ÄúQuick Connect‚Äù**, which automatically connected me to a nearby server ‚Äî in this case, it was **Netherlands**.

---

### 5. **Check IP Address (To Verify VPN is Working)**

I visited [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) before and after connecting the VPN.

* Before VPN: it showed my real location.
* After VPN: it showed a **new IP address** from the Netherlands.

This confirmed that the VPN was successfully hiding my real IP.

---

### 6. **Test Encrypted Traffic**

I opened websites like **Google** and **Reddit** ‚Äî they loaded normally and used **HTTPS**, showing traffic was encrypted.

---

### 7. **Disconnect VPN and Compare**

I turned off the VPN and checked the IP again ‚Äî it went back to my real location.
Also noticed that the browsing speed slightly improved after disconnecting.

---

### üß† Summary

This simple procedure helped me learn how VPNs can **mask your location, encrypt your traffic**, and **protect your privacy**, especially on public Wi-Fi.
It‚Äôs an easy and useful tool, but it‚Äôs important to understand its limits ‚Äî like slower speed and limited access on free plans.
